dotNETwebApi

Project created to simulate having a ASP.NET Core Back-End and consume it via an Angular App as Front-End.

This project was generated via Visual Studio 2022. EntityFrameWorkCore is used as the ORM to standarized the way data is returned.

CORS has been enabled to allow the Front-End to communicate with the API.

TODO:

Update CORS to allow specific request sources and better security.
